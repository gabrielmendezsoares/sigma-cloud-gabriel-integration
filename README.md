# 🚨 Sigma Cloud Gabriel Integration

## 📋 Overview

This service facilitates integration between Sigma Cloud and Gabriel video surveillance systems, enabling real-time alarm event forwarding. It listens for alarms triggered by Gabriel devices, enriches them with contextual data (such as account, partition, IP, MAC, and channel information), transforms them into Sigma Cloud-compatible formats, and sends them to the Sigma Cloud Events API.

The service also stores the status of each event (sent or failed) in a local database for monitoring, auditing, and retry logic. This integration ensures that motion and intrusion alarms from Gabriel devices are seamlessly reflected in Sigma Cloud’s central monitoring interface.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Integrate Gabriel alarms into the Sigma Cloud platform in real-time
- Enrich alarm data with account, partition, network, and channel context using Segware’s Accounts API
- Map and transform event types (e.g., motion and intrusion) into standardized Sigma Cloud Contact ID codes
- Authenticate securely via Bearer tokens for protected API communication with Sigma Cloud
- Log and persist all alarm events, including their metadata and delivery status (sent or failed)
- Provide fault-tolerant handling for failures in external APIs with isolated retries and status tracking
- Support scalable and concurrent alarm processing using Promise.allSettled for high-throughput environments
